# TNLS
This repository is an alpha implementation of the Snakepath Network and its underlying TNLS protocol, currently connecting the Eth Goerli testnet to the Secret Network pulsar-3 testnet.

Docs (which are relatively barebones atm but will be being improved over time) can be found at [our gitbook](https://fortress-labs.gitbook.io/snakepath/).
